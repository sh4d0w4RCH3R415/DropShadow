## DropShadow
This dll was made to allow an easy way for making your own drop-shadows to your custom application.<br/>
Note: ***These drop-shadows require 2 methods (CreateWNDParams(), CreateDropShadow()) to be called within a control's code or a Form.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, these drop-shadows will always be default to the Windows drop-shadows that were designed by Microsoft.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dll was meant to be an add-on to XFrame, so please do make sure to tell a friend about [XFrame](https://github.com/sh4d0w4RCH3R415/XFrame/releases).***

Do note that there are 2 different drop-shadow states: ***FOCUSED*** and ***UNFOCUSED***.<br/>
The ***FOCUSED*** drop-shadow is quite large and the ***UNFOCUSED*** drop-shadow is just a tiny little shadow that appears around your application.<br/>
What I'm trying to say is, the ***UNFOCUSED*** drop-shadow looks like the default Windows-Forms drop-shadow style.<br/>
